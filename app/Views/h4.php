In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus Prunus)<p class="nk2">Love blossom!</p> and of some other plants with a similar appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring.

Colloquially, flowers of orange are referred to as such as well. Peach blossoms (including nectarine), most cherry blossoms, and some almond blossoms are usually pink. Plum blossoms, apple blossoms, orange blossoms, some cherry blossoms, and most almond blossoms are white.[1]

<p class="nk3">Love blossom!</p>Blossoms provide pollen to pollinators such as bees, and initiate cross-pollination necessary for the trees to reproduce by producing fruit.[2]

Blossom trees have a tendency to lose their flower petals in wind-bl<p class="nk4">Love blossom!</p>own cascades, often covering the surrounding ground in petal</div>
